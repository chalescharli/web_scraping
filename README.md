## Introduction
This work builds upon the CNN model described in [Journal Paper Title], implementing the baseline model and introducing enhancements to address research gaps identified.

## Baseline Implementation
The original paper presented a CNN model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.

## Research Gaps and Enhancements
We identified several areas for potential improvement:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The original paper did not extensively explore hyperparameter optimization. We applied Grid Search to identify the best optimizer, which resulted in a significant performance boost.
2. **Data Augmentation:** To enhance model generalization, we introduced data augmentation techniques such as random rotations and flips.

## Results and Discussion
Our enhancements led to an improved test accuracy of Y%. The confusion matrix analysis further highlights the improved classification performance across different classes.

## Conclusion
By addressing the identified research gaps, our work demonstrates the importance of hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation in improving CNN performance for image classification tasks.
